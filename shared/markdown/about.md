# About Us

Streem Technologies is building tools to reduce latency for
live data and minimise bandwidth for a variety of
high-throughput applications. With our technologies, we're
improving existing services such as live video and latency
reduction for gaming, while laying the groundwork to let
emergent technologies like AR, VR and self-driving cars be
used today.
